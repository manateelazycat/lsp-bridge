# lsp-bridge

Lsp-bridge's goal is to become the fastest LSP client in Emacs.

Lsp-bridge uses python's threading technology to build caches that bridge Emacs and LSP server. Lsp-bridge will provide smooth completion experience without compromise to slow down emacs' performance.

4. Add following code in your ~/.emacs:

```elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "<path-to-lsp-bridge>")

(require 'yasnippet)
(require 'lsp-bridge)
(require 'lsp-bridge-jdtls)       ;; provide Java third-party library jump and -data directory support, optional

## Commands

* lsp-bridge-find-def: jump to the definition
* lsp-bridge-find-def-other-window: jump to the definition in other-window
* lsp-bridge-find-impl: jump to the implementation
* lsp-bridge-find-impl-other-window: jump to the implementation in other-window
* lsp-bridge-return-from-def: return to the location before calling `lsp-bridge-find-def`
* lsp-bridge-find-references: traverse across code references (forked from color-rg.el)
* lsp-bridge-lookup-documentation: lookup documentation of symbol under the cursor
* lsp-bridge-rename: rename symbol under the cursor
* lsp-bridge-show-signature-help-in-minibuffer: show signature help in minibuffer manually (move cursor to parameters area will show signature help automatically)
* lsp-bridge-insert-common-prefix: insert common prefix of candidates
* lsp-bridge-restart-process: restart lsp-bridge process (only used for development)

After enable Xref support, the commands for Xref is available, we currently supported and tested those:

* xref-find-definitions: jump to the definition
* xref-go-back: return to the location before calling `xref-find-definitions`
* xref-go-forward: jump to the location before calling `xref-go-back`

## Customize language server configuration

The default configuration of for each language server is stored at [lsp-bridge/langserver](https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge/tree/master/langserver).

Anyway you can customize server configuration with the following priority:
1. ```lsp-bridge-get-lang-server-by-project```: write your own function to get server configuration based on project-path and file-path, this function is nil by default
2. ```lsp-bridge-lang-server-extension-list```: load server configuration based on file extension, such as, we launch ```volar``` server instead ```javascript``` server when open *.vue file
3. ```lsp-bridge-lang-server-mode-list```: load server configuration based on major-mode

## Add support for new language?

1. Create configuration file under lsp-bridge/langserver, such as `pyright.json` for pyright (windows user please uses `pyright_windows.json`, macOS user please uses `pyright_darwin.json`).
2. Add `(mode . server_name)` in ```lsp-bridge-lang-server-list```, such as `(python-mode . "pyright")`
3. Add new mode-hook to `lsp-bridge-default-mode-hooks`

Welcome to send PR to help us improve support for LSP servers, thanks for your contribution!

### TODO:

- [ ] Show signature help with eldoc
- [ ] Code action
- [ ] Inline Value
- [ ] Caches diagnostic information, displaying the diagnostic information after user stop typing 1 second
- [ ] JavaSctipt different code blocks use different language servers
- [ ] Support completionItem/resolve to implement auto-import for volar
- [ ] Cache candidate document at Python side, only fetch document information when switch candidate.

### Features that won't be supported

The goal of lsp-bridge is to become the fastest LSP client in Emacs, not a complete implementation of LSP protocol.

Emacs can do better for the following tasks, we will not reinvent the wheel in lsp-bridge:
1. Code formatting: each LSP server has its own formatting specification, we can gain finer control using Emacs' builtin formatting tool.
2. Syntax highlighting: [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) is a wonderful incremental parsing library for syntax highlighting.

Please read [LSP Specification](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/) and [The Design of lsp-bridge](https://manateelazycat.github.io/emacs/2022/05/12/lsp-bridge.html) first.

Then turn on option ```lsp-bridge-enable-log``` and happy hacking! ;)

## Report bug

Please use `emacs -q` and load a minimal setup with only lsp-bridge to verify that the bug is reproducible. If `emacs -q` works fine, probably something is wrong with your Emacs config.

If the problem still exists, please report it [here](https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge/issues/new) with `*lsp-bridge*` buffer content, it contains many clues that can help us locate the problem faster.

If you get a segfault error, please use the following way to collect crash information:

1. Install gdb and turn on option `lsp-bridge-enable-debug`
2. Use the command `lsp-bridge-stop-process` to stop the current process
3. Restart lsp-bridge, send issue with `*lsp-bridge*` buffer content when next crash
