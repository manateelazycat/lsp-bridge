# lsp-bridge

The goal of lsp-bridge is to implement the fastest LSP client in the Emacs ecosystem.

Using Python multithreading techniques, lsp-bridge builds a high-speed cache between Emacs and the LSP server, ensuring that Emacs never gets stuck while providing a smooth and seamless code completion experience.

## Installation

1. Install Emacs version 28 or higher.
2. Install Python dependencies: `pip3 install epc orjson sexpdata six` (orjson is optional and provides faster JSON parsing performance based on Rust).
3. Install Elisp dependencies:
+ [posframe](https://github.com/tumashu/posframe)
+ [markdown-mode](https://github.com/jrblevin/markdown-mode)
+ [yasnippet](https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet)
+ [acm-terminal](https://github.com/twlz0ne/acm-terminal) (optional, only for terminal user)
4. Download this repository using git clone, and replace the load-path path in the configuration below.
5. Add the following code to your configuration file ~/.emacs:

```elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "<path-to-lsp-bridge>")

(require 'yasnippet)
(yas-global-mode 1)

(require 'lsp-bridge)
(global-lsp-bridge-mode)
```

Please note that:

1. When using lsp-bridge, please first disable other completion plugins such as lsp-mode, eglot, company, corfu, etc. Lsp-bridge provides a complete solution from completion backend, frontend to multi-backend fusion.
2. When the completion menu pops up, `acm-mode` will be automatically enabled, and when the completion menu disappears, `acm-mode` will be automatically disabled. Please do not manually add `acm-mode` to any mode-hook or manually execute `acm-mode`.

## Usage
Lsp-bridge works out of the box. After installing the corresponding [LSP server](https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge#supported-language-servers) and mode plugin for the language, you can start coding directly without any additional settings.

It should be noted that lsp-bridge has three scanning modes:

1. When the `.git` directory is detected (determined by the command `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`), lsp-bridge will scan the entire directory to provide completion.
2. When the `.git` directory is not detected, lsp-bridge only provides single-file completion for the opened file.
3. Custom `lsp-bridge-get-project-path-by-filepath` function, where the input parameter is the path string of the opened file and the output parameter is the project directory path. Lsp-bridge will provide completion based on the output directory path.

## Customize language server configuration

The configuration for the LSP server of each language in lsp-bridge is stored in [lsp-bridge/langserver](https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge/tree/master/langserver).

In most cases, you can customize the server configuration according to the following priority order:
1. `lsp-bridge-get-single-lang-server-by-project`: A user-defined function that takes project-path and file-path as input parameters and returns the corresponding LSP server string. You can query the names of all LSP servers in the lsp-bridge-single-lang-server-mode-list list. By default, this function returns nil.
2. `lsp-bridge-single-lang-server-extension-list`: Returns the server based on the file extension, for example, when opening a *.wxml file, we will use the wxml LSP server for completion.
3. `lsp-bridge-single-lang-server-mode-list`: Returns the corresponding server based on Emacs's major-mode.

If you are writing JavaScript code, you may need to customize multiple server configurations:
1. `lsp-bridge-get-multi-lang-server-by-project`: A user-defined function that takes project-path and file-path as input parameters and returns the multiple server configuration names. You can search for them in the subdirectory [lsp-bridge/multiserver](https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge/tree/master/multiserver).
2. `lsp-bridge-multi-lang-server-extension-list`: Returns multiple server configuration names based on the file extension. For example, when opening a *.vue file, we will use volar_emmet to simultaneously utilize volar and emmet-ls for completion.
3. `lsp-bridge-multi-lang-server-mode-list`: Returns the corresponding multiple server configuration names based on Emacs's major-mode.

For example, we can enable the Deno LSP server for Deno scripts with the following configuration:

```elisp
(setq lsp-bridge-get-single-lang-server-by-project
      (lambda (project-path filepath)
        ;; If typescript file include deno.land url, then use Deno LSP server.
        (save-excursion
          (when (string-equal (file-name-extension filepath) "ts")
            (dolist (buf (buffer-list))
              (when (string-equal (buffer-file-name buf) filepath)
                (with-current-buffer buf
                  (goto-char (point-min))
                  (when (search-forward-regexp (regexp-quote "from \"https://deno.land") nil t)
                    (return "deno")))))))))
```

## Customize language server configuration file
Copy the configuration files in [lsp-bridge/langserver](https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge/tree/master/langserver) or [lsp-bridge/multiserver](https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge/tree/master/multiserver) to lsp-bridge-user-langserver-dir or lsp-bridge-user-multiserver-dir for customization. Lsp-bridge will prioritize reading the configuration files in lsp-bridge-user-langserver-dir or lsp-bridge-user-multiserver-dir.

We can set the value of lsp-bridge-user-langserver-dir or lsp-bridge-user-multiserver-dir before starting lsp-bridge-mode to achieve different project-specific configuration files.


```elisp
(defun enable-lsp-bridge()
  (when-let* ((project (project-current))
              (project-root (nth 2 project)))
    (setq-local lsp-bridge-user-langserver-dir project-root
                lsp-bridge-user-multiserver-dir project-root))
  (lsp-bridge-mode))
```


## Add support for new language?

1. Create a configuration file in the lsp-bridge/langserver directory. For example, `pyright.json` is the configuration file for the pyright server (use `pyright_windows.json` for Windows and `pyright_darwin.json` for macOS).
2. Add `(mode . server_name)` to the `lsp-bridge-single-lang-server-mode-list` option in the lsp-bridge.el file, for example, `(python-mode . "pyright")`.
3. Add a new mode-hook to the `lsp-bridge-default-mode-hooks` option in the lsp-bridge.el file.
4. Add a new indentation variable to the `lsp-bridge-formatting-indent-alist` option in the lsp-bridge.el file.

We welcome patches to help us support more LSP servers. Thank you for your help!

## Supported language servers

You need to install the LSP server corresponding to each programming language, then lsp-bridge can provide code completion service.

Please read below articles first:
* [LSP Specification](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/)
* [The Design of lsp-bridge](https://manateelazycat.github.io/emacs/2022/05/12/lsp-bridge.html)
* [Why lsp-bridge not use capf](https://manateelazycat.github.io/emacs/2022/06/26/why-lsp-bridge-not-use-capf.html)
* [lsp-bridge Wiki](https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge/wiki)

Then turn on develop option ```lsp-bridge-enable-log``` and happy hacking! ;)


## Report bug

For some common problems, please read [Wiki](https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge/wiki) first.

Please use `emacs -q` and load a minimal setup with only lsp-bridge to verify that the bug is reproducible. If `emacs -q` works fine, probably something is wrong with your Emacs config.

If the problem still exists, please report it [here](https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge/issues/new) with `*lsp-bridge*` buffer content, it contains many clues that can help us locate the problem faster.

* If you get a segfault error, please use the following way to collect crash information:
  1. Install gdb and turn on option `lsp-bridge-enable-debug`
  2. Use the command `lsp-bridge-restart-process` to restart the `LSP-BRIDGE` process
  3. Send issue with `*lsp-bridge*` buffer content when next crash

* If you get other errors, please use the following way to collection information:
  1. turn on option `lsp-bridge-enable-log`
  2. Use the command `lsp-bridge-restart-process` to restart the `LSP-BRIDGE` process
  3. Send issue with `*lsp-bridge*` buffer content
