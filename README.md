# lsp-bridge

Lsp-bridge's goal is to become the fastest LSP client in Emacs.

Lsp-bridge uses python's threading technology to build caches that bridge Emacs and LSP server. Lsp-bridge will provide smooth completion experience without compromise to slow down emacs' performance.

## Installation

1. Install Python dependencies: [python-epc](https://github.com/tkf/python-epc)
2. Install Elisp dependencies:
+ [posframe](https://github.com/tumashu/posframe)
+ [markdown-mode](https://github.com/jrblevin/markdown-mode)
+ [yasnippet](https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet)
3. Clone or download this repository (path of the folder is the `<path-to-lsp-bridge>` used below).
4. Add following code in your ~/.emacs:

```elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "<path-to-lsp-bridge>")

(require 'yasnippet)
(yas-global-mode 1)

(require 'lsp-bridge)
(global-lsp-bridge-mode)
```

## Usage
lsp-bridge is design for out the box. After installing the [LSP server](https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge#supported-language-servers) and mode plugin corresponding to the open file, you can write the code directly without additional settings.

It should be noted that there are three scan modes of lsp-bridge:
1. When detecting the `.git` directory (check by command `git rev-parse-is-inside-work-tree`), lsp-bridge scan the entire directory file to provide completion
2. When the `.git` directory was not detected, lsp-bridge only scan opened file to provide completion
3. Custom `lsp-bridge-get-project-path-by-filepath` function, the input parameter is the path string of opened file, the output parameter is the project directory path, lsp-bridge will scan project directory path to provide provide completion

## Customize language server configuration

The default configuration of for each language server is stored at [lsp-bridge/langserver](https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge/tree/master/langserver).

In most cases, you can customize server configuration with the following priority:
1. ```lsp-bridge-get-single-lang-server-by-project```: The user custom function, the input parameter is `project-path` and `file-path`, return the corresponding LSP server string, you can query all LSP servers in the list of `lsp-bridge-single-lang-server-mode-list` option, this function return nil default
2. ```lsp-bridge-single-lang-server-extension-list```: load server configuration based on file extension, such as, we launch ```wxml``` server when open *.wxml file
3. ```lsp-bridge-single-lang-server-mode-list```: load server configuration based on major-mode

If you are writing JavaScript code, you may need to customize multi-server configuration:
1. ```lsp-bridge-get-multi-lang-server-by-project```: The user custom function, the input parameter is `project-path` and `file-path`, return the multi-server configuration name, you can find configuration name in the subdirectory
[lsp-bridge/multiserver](https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge/tree/master/multiserver)
2. ```lsp-bridge-multi-lang-server-extension-list```: Return multi-server configuration name according to the expansion of the file, for example, when opening the *.vue file, we will use the `volar` and `emmet-ls` to provide completion service
3. ```lsp-bridge-multi-lang-server-mode-list```: Return the corresponding multi-server configuration name according to Emacs's major-mode

## Add support for new language?

1. Create configuration file under lsp-bridge/langserver, such as `pyright.json` for pyright (windows user please uses `pyright_windows.json`, macOS user please uses `pyright_darwin.json`).
2. Add `(mode . server_name)` to `lsp-bridge-single-lang-server-mode-list` in `lsp-bridge.el`, such as `(python-mode . "pyright")`.
3. Add new mode-hook to `lsp-bridge-default-mode-hooks` in `lsp-bridge.el`.
4. Add new mode indent to `lsp-bridge-formatting-indent-alist` in `lsp-bridge.el`.

Welcome to send PR to help us improve support for LSP servers, thanks for your contribution!

## Supported language servers

You need to install the LSP server corresponding to each programming language, then lsp-bridge can provide code completion service.

### Features that won't be supported

The goal of lsp-bridge is to become the fastest LSP client in Emacs, not a complete implementation of LSP protocol.

Emacs can do better for the following tasks, we will not reinvent the wheel in lsp-bridge:
1. Syntax highlighting: [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) is a wonderful incremental parsing library for syntax highlighting.
2. Xref: Xref's mechanism is synchronous, but lsp-bridge is completely asynchronous. I recommended binding your xref key to a wrapper function that combines xref and lsp-bridge together.

## Join development

The following is the framework of lsp-bridge:

Please read below articles first:
* [LSP Specification](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/)
* [The Design of lsp-bridge](https://manateelazycat.github.io/emacs/2022/05/12/lsp-bridge.html)
* [Why lsp-bridge not use capf](https://manateelazycat.github.io/emacs/2022/06/26/why-lsp-bridge-not-use-capf.html)

Then turn on develop option ```lsp-bridge-enable-log``` and happy hacking! ;)

## Report bug

Please use `emacs -q` and load a minimal setup with only lsp-bridge to verify that the bug is reproducible. If `emacs -q` works fine, probably something is wrong with your Emacs config.

If the problem still exists, please report it [here](https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge/issues/new) with `*lsp-bridge*` buffer content, it contains many clues that can help us locate the problem faster.

If you get a segfault error, please use the following way to collect crash information:

1. Install gdb and turn on option `lsp-bridge-enable-debug`
2. Use the command `lsp-bridge-stop-process` to stop the current process
3. Restart lsp-bridge, send issue with `*lsp-bridge*` buffer content when next crash
