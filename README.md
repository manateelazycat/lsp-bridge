# lsp-bridge

The goal of lsp-bridge is use multi-thread technology to implement the fastest LSP client in the Emacs ecosystem.

Advantages of lsp-bridge:
1. Blazingly fast: Offload LSP request and data analysis to an external process, preventing Emacs from getting stuck due to delays or large data triggering garbage collection
2. Remote Completion: Built-in support for remote server code completion, with various login methods such as passwords and public keys, supports tramp protocol and jump server
3. Out of the box: Ready to use immediately after installation, no additional configuration required, no need to tweak with completion frontend, completion backend and multi-backend mix
4. Multiple Server Integration: Can simultaneously use multiple LSP servers to serve the same file, for example, Python can have Pyright for code completion and Ruff for diagnostics and formatting
5. Flexible Customization: Customizing LSP server options is as simple as using a JSON file, allowing different projects to have different JSON configurations with just a few lines of rules

## Installation

1. Install Emacs 28 or higher version
2. Install Python dependencies: `pip3 install epc orjson sexpdata six setuptools paramiko rapidfuzz` (orjson is optional, orjson is based on Rust, providing faster JSON parsing performance)
3. Install Elisp dependencies: [markdown-mode](https://github.com/jrblevin/markdown-mode), [yasnippet](https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet)

4. Download this repository using git clone, and replace the load-path path in the configuration below.
5. Add the following code to your configuration file ~/.emacs:

```elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "<path-to-lsp-bridge>")

(require 'yasnippet)
(yas-global-mode 1)

(require 'lsp-bridge)
(global-lsp-bridge-mode)
```

To use terminal mode, please install [acm-terminal](https://github.com/twlz0ne/acm-terminal). However, it's essential to note that acm-terminal may potentially cause compatibility issues due to modifications made to the acm.el code by me. Should such an occurrence arise, you can report any problems as an issue in the repository of acm-terminal, as its creator is a highly skilled developer who will swiftly address any compatibility issues.

* If you are using straight to install, you should use the following configuration to install:

```elisp
(use-package lsp-bridge
  :straight '(lsp-bridge :type git :host github :repo "manateelazycat/lsp-bridge"
            :files (:defaults "*.el" "*.py" "acm" "core" "langserver" "multiserver" "resources")
            :build (:not compile))
  :init
  (global-lsp-bridge-mode))
```

* If you are using `doom-emacs`

add this to your `packages.el`

``` elisp
(when (package! lsp-bridge
        :recipe (:host github
                 :repo "manateelazycat/lsp-bridge"
                 :branch "master"
                 :files ("*.el" "*.py" "acm" "core" "langserver" "multiserver" "resources")
                 ;; do not perform byte compilation or native compilation for lsp-bridge
                 :build (:not compile)))
  (package! markdown-mode)
  (package! yasnippet))
```

and add this to your `config.el`

``` elisp
(use-package! lsp-bridge
  :config
  (setq lsp-bridge-enable-log nil)
  (global-lsp-bridge-mode))
```

and run `doom sync` to install it.

### If you are unable to use normally after installing it, please read [Report bug](https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge?tab=readme-ov-file#report-bug) first

Please note:

1. When using lsp-bridge, please first disable other completion plugins, such as lsp-mode, eglot, company, corfu, etc. lsp-bridge provides a complete solution from the completion backend, completion frontend to multi-backend integration
2. In addition to providing LSP completion, lsp-bridge also provides many non-LSP completion backends, including file words, paths, Yas/Tempel, TabNine, Codeium, Copilot, Citre, Tailwind, Ctags, Org roam and other completion backends. If you expect to provide these completions in a certain mode, please add the corresponding mode to `lsp-bridge-default-mode-hooks`
3. Please do not perform ```byte compilation``` or ```native compilation``` for lsp-bridge as it will result in a difference in API and the latest version after upgrading compiling afterwards, Lsp-bridge is designed with multi-threading that does not require compilation to speed it up

## Local Usage

Lsp-bridge works out of the box. After installing the corresponding [LSP server](https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge#supported-language-servers) and mode plugin for the language, you can start coding directly without any additional settings.

It should be noted that lsp-bridge has three scanning modes:

1. Determine the project's root directory by searching upward for a `.git` or `.dir-locals.el` file, thereby providing completion for the entire project directory.
2. If a `.git` or `.dir-locals.el` file is not found, lsp-bridge will only provide single file completion for the opened file.
3. You can also tell lsp-bridge the root directory of the project by customizing the `lsp-bridge-get-project-path-by-filepath` function. This function takes the path string of the opened file as the input parameter and outputs the project directory path.

## Remote Usage

`lsp-bridge` can perform code syntax completion on files on a remote server, similar to VSCode. The configuration steps are as follows:

1. Install lsp-bridge and the corresponding LSP Server on the remote server.
2. Start lsp-bridge: `python3 lsp-bridge/lsp_bridge.py`.
3. Use the `lsp-bridge-open-remote-file` command to open files, entering the username, IP, SSH port (default 22), and path, such as `user@ip:[ssh_port]:/path/file`
4. Enabling the `lsp-bridge-enable-with-tramp` option allows direct opening of tramp files, using the efficient algorithm of lsp-bridge instead of tramp, achieving smooth completion. If the host in tramp is defined in `~/.ssh/config`, lsp-bridge can synchronize the following options for remote connection:
   - HostName (must be in IP format, domain format may cause issues)
   - User
   - Port
   - GSSAPIAuthentication
   - ProxyCommand (currently only supports ProxyCommand option, does not support ProxyJump option)
5. `(setq lsp-bridge-remote-start-automatically t)` can automatically
start the lsp_bridge.py process on the remote host (which needs to support bash) when opening a tramp file, and it will also automatically close the process when quitting emacs. When using this feature, the following options need to be correctly set:
    - lsp-bridge-remote-python-command: the name of the python command on the remote host
    - lsp-bridge-remote-python-file: the full path of lsp_bridge.py on the remote host
    - lsp-bridge-remote-log: the full path for log output of lsp_bridge.py on the remote host

Principle of remote completion:

1. Log in to the server with SSH authentication, access and edit files.
2. When editing a replica of a remote file, real-time diff sequences will be sent to lsp-bridge, and the server side will use these sequences to rebuild the file and calculate the completion data by the remote LSP Server.
3. The remote LSP Server will send back the completion data to the local side, and Emacs will display the completion menu.

Note:

1. If the completion menu is not displayed, check the output of `lsp_bridge.py` on the remote server, it may be that the LSP Server is not fully installed.
2. lsp-bridge will use the first *.pub file in `~/.ssh` as a login credential. If public key login fails, you will be asked to enter a password. lsp-bridge will not store the password, it is recommended to use public key login to avoid repeated password entry.
3. To run lsp_bridge.py successfully you need to completely download the entire git repository of lsp-bridge on a remote server, and switch into its directory, lsp_bridge.py requires other files to function properly, so copying only the lsp_bridge.py file can't work
4. If a tramp file encounters an lsp-bridge connection error, you can execute the `lsp-bridge-tramp-show-hostnames` function and then check if the output of the host configuration options meets expectations

## Customize language server configuration

The configuration for the LSP server of each language in lsp-bridge is stored in [lsp-bridge/langserver](https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge/tree/master/langserver).

In most cases, you can customize the server configuration according to the following priority order:

1. `lsp-bridge-get-single-lang-server-by-project`: A user-defined function that takes project-path and file-path as input parameters and returns the corresponding LSP server string. You can query the names of all LSP servers in the lsp-bridge-single-lang-server-mode-list list. By default, this function returns nil.
2. `lsp-bridge-single-lang-server-extension-list`: Returns the server based on the file extension, for example, when opening a \*.wxml file, we will use the wxml LSP server for completion.
3. `lsp-bridge-single-lang-server-mode-list`: Returns the corresponding server based on Emacs’s major-mode.

If you are writing JavaScript code, you may need to customize multiple server configurations:

1. `lsp-bridge-get-multi-lang-server-by-project`: A user-defined function that takes project-path and file-path as input parameters and returns the multiple server configuration names. You can search for them in the subdirectory [lsp-bridge/multiserver](https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge/tree/master/multiserver).
2. `lsp-bridge-multi-lang-server-extension-list`: Returns multiple server configuration names based on the file extension. For example, when opening a \*.vue file, we will use volar_emmet to simultaneously utilize volar and emmet-ls for completion.
3. `lsp-bridge-multi-lang-server-mode-list`: Returns the corresponding multiple server configuration names based on Emacs’s major-mode.

For example, we can enable the Deno LSP server for Deno scripts with the following configuration:

```elisp
(setq lsp-bridge-get-multi-lang-server-by-project
      (lambda (project-path filepath)
        ;; If typescript file include deno.land url, then use Deno LSP server.
        (save-excursion
          (when (string-equal (file-name-extension filepath) "ts")
            (dolist (buf (buffer-list))
              (when (string-equal (buffer-file-name buf) filepath)
                (with-current-buffer buf
                  (goto-char (point-min))
                  (when (search-forward-regexp (regexp-quote "from \"https://deno.land") nil t)
                    (return "deno")))))))))
```

## Customize language server configuration file

Copy the configuration files in [lsp-bridge/langserver](https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge/tree/master/langserver) or [lsp-bridge/multiserver](https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge/tree/master/multiserver) to lsp-bridge-user-langserver-dir or lsp-bridge-user-multiserver-dir for customization. Lsp-bridge will prioritize reading the configuration files in lsp-bridge-user-langserver-dir or lsp-bridge-user-multiserver-dir.

We can set the value of lsp-bridge-user-langserver-dir or lsp-bridge-user-multiserver-dir before starting lsp-bridge-mode to achieve different project-specific configuration files.

```elisp
(defun enable-lsp-bridge()
  (when-let* ((project (project-current))
              (project-root (nth 2 project)))
    (setq-local lsp-bridge-user-langserver-dir project-root
                lsp-bridge-user-multiserver-dir project-root))
  (lsp-bridge-mode))
```

## LSP server options
lsp-bridge provides support for more than two language servers for many languages. You can customize the following options to choose the language server you prefer:

- `lsp-bridge-c-lsp-server`: C language server, you can choose `clangd` or`ccls`
- `lsp-bridge-elixir-lsp-server`: Elixir language server, you can choose `elixirLS`(default) or`lexical`
- `lsp-bridge-python-lsp-server`: Python language server, you can choose `pyright`, `jedi`, `python-ms`, `pylsp`, `ruff`, it's important to note that lsp-bridge-multi-lang-server-mode-list has a higher priority than lsp-bridge-single-lang-server-mode-list. If you only want to use a single server, please first remove the python-mode setting from lsp-bridge-multi-lang-server-mode-list.
- `lsp-bridge-php-lsp-server`: PHP language server, you can choose `intelephense` or `phpactor`
- `lsp-bridge-tex-lsp-server`: LaTeX language server, you can choose `texlab` or`digestif`

## Add support for new language?

1. Create a configuration file in the lsp-bridge/langserver directory. For example, `pyright.json` is the configuration file for the pyright server (use `pyright_windows.json` for Windows and `pyright_darwin.json` for macOS).
2. Add `(mode . server_name)` to the `lsp-bridge-single-lang-server-mode-list` option in the lsp-bridge.el file, for example, `(python-mode . "pyright")`.
3. Add a new mode-hook to the `lsp-bridge-default-mode-hooks` option in the lsp-bridge.el file.
4. Add a new indentation variable to the `lsp-bridge-formatting-indent-alist` option in the lsp-bridge.el file.

We welcome patches to help us support more LSP servers. Thank you for your help!

## Supported language servers

You need to install the LSP server corresponding to each programming language, then lsp-bridge can provide code completion service.

If your language supports mixed multi-language servers, it is recommended to check the multi-language server definition under [multiserver](https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge/tree/master/multiserver), and install multiple LSP servers to get a more complete experience. For example, for the Python language, according to the default [pyright-background-analysis_ruff.json](https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge/tree/master/multiserver/pyright-background-analysis_ruff.json) definition, you should install `pyright` and `ruff`.

Then turn on develop option `lsp-bridge-enable-log` and happy hacking! ;)

## Report bug

**For some common problems, please read [Wiki](https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge/wiki) first.**

Please use `emacs -q` and load a minimal setup with only lsp-bridge to verify that the bug is reproducible. If `emacs -q` works fine, probably something is wrong with your Emacs config.

If the problem still exists:
1. Turn on option `lsp-bridge-enable-log`
2. Use `lsp-bridge-restart-process` to restart the `LSP-BRIDGE` process
3. Report issue with `*lsp-bridge*` buffer content, it contains many clues that can help us locate the problem faster

If you get a segfault error, please use the following way to collect crash information:

  1. Install gdb and turn on option `lsp-bridge-enable-debug`
  2. Use the command `lsp-bridge-restart-process` to restart the `LSP-BRIDGE` process
  3. Send issue with `*lsp-bridge*` buffer content when next crash

## Contributor
lsp-bridge's rapid development couldn't have been possible without the strong support and selfless contributions from the community's experts. Without the community’s support, lsp-bridge wouldn’t be where it is today. Thank you to the loveliest people in the world, happy hacking ;)
